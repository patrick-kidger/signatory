### Bug reports

Hopefully we don't get too many of these! But if you think you've found a bug, then go ahead and open an issue. Please make sure to include your operating system, Python version, and the version of Signatory that you are using. This can be found my running the terminal command `python -c "import signatory; print(signatory.__version__)"`.

### I've got a question

First have a look at the documentation located [here](https://signatory.readthedocs.io). If that doesn't answer your question then please open an issue detailing your question.

### Feature request

### Contributing code
